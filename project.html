                <h3>We would like to talk about our experience participating in the Hour of Code event through <a class='link' href='https://www.code.org/' target="_blank">Code.org</a>. This event provided us with an opportunity to explore coding and its many possibilities in a fun and engaging way. After learning the basics of coding through interactive games and activities, we were inspired to share our knowledge with others. So, we went to a local school and explained the basics of coding to the students. It was a rewarding experience to see the excitement on the students' faces as they discovered the potential of coding. This event not only helped us develop our skills in web development but also gave us a chance to give back to our community. We believe that events like the Hour of Code are essential in promoting interest in coding and helping people discover their potential in this field.</h3>

                    <h2>Hour of Code event for school students</h2>
                    <p>On 2nd March 2022, Codebreakers organized Hour of Code inspired by <a class='link' href='https://www.code.org/' target="_blank">Code.org</a> in Khirdalan city, school number 5. The main goal of the project was to teach students about the fundamentals of programming and inform them about the existing opportunities in ADA University. Scroll down and learn more about our project! You can watch the video from our project in our <a class='link' href='http://surl.li/gjmdc' target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a>.</p>

                    <h2>What was the main goal of this event?</h2>
                    <p>As students at SITE School in ADA University, we were excited to share our knowledge and experiences with the next generation of coders for the sake of development of Azerbaijanian society. We focused on teaching students the fundamentals of programming using Code.org and help them to understand the concept of the code.</p>

                    <h2>How did we manage to have successful delivery of the project?</h2>
                    <p>While organizing the project, we made sure that the division of work is fair and thought of how to overcome every bottleneck that can appear during the event. Our team’s motivation and students’ enthusiasm and willingness to learn made our project delivery enjoyable and successful.</p>

                    <h2>Did we face any challenges during the project?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we did. Some of the challenges we faced were like a weak internet speed problem, non-working computers in Computer Lab, some kids making noise and not paying enough attention to event. But the biggest challenge we faced was the discrimination of girls using computers and learning to code together with boys. Fortunately, we managed to solve this problem and ensured that every student benefited from our event.</p>
                    <p class="thanks"><br><br><br><br>
                        Big thanks to everyone who supported us!<br><br>
                        We would like to send our gratitude to the school administration and teachers for their hospitality throughout the session. Also, we are thankful to our university for providing us with guidance and resources that helped us to hold the event successfully!
