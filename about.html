              <h1>Information about our Web site:</h1>
                <p>Our website project aims to serve as a comprehensive platform to showcase the work that we have accomplished as a team, share our experience and knowledge gained through various coding events, and promote interest in the field of coding and technology. We intend to provide valuable information regarding our team, including details about each team member, our experience participating in Hour of Code event, and the lessons learned during the event. Our website project will also showcase our coding skills, as we aim to design and develop a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing website that is accessible to all.</p>
                <p>The <font color="red">HTML</font>, <font color="cornflowerblue">CSS margins</font> and <font color="yellow">JavaScript</font> programming presented us with a number of difficulties while we worked on building our website. One of the most common issues was with margins, where we had to adjust the margins of various elements to align them properly and ensure consistency throughout the website. In order to keep the design looking orderly, it was crucial to maintain a balance between each piece with adequate space. Comprehending <font color="yellow">JavaScript</font> programming ideas and successfully putting them into practice was another difficulty we encountered. To integrate <font color="yellow">JavaScript</font> with the website and comprehend its syntax and logic, we had to put in extra work. In order to design a website that looked professional and met the client's expectations, our team overcame these obstacles by utilizing online resources including tutorials and discussion boards.</p>
                <p>Despite these obstacles, our team was able to produce a website that not only showcases our work, experiences, and abilities in the field of technology and coding but also as a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn more about coding and web development.</p>
                <p>In addition, our website project has been an excellent opportunity for us to learn and collaborate. Through this project, we have not only improved our technical skills but also developed valuable problem-solving skills. We are confident that our website project will inspire others to pursue their passion for coding and technology and contribute to the growth of the industry.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, our website project is aimed at providing a platform to showcase our team's work and experiences in coding, while promoting interest and providing helpful resources for those interested in the field of technology. We faced several challenges while working on the project, including difficulties with <font color="red">HTML</font>, <font color="cornflowerblue">CSS margins</font> and <font color="yellow">JavaScript</font> programming. However, through perseverance and utilizing online resources, we were able to overcome these obstacles and produce a website that meets our client's expectations. Furthermore, the project has been an excellent opportunity for us to learn and collaborate, improving our technical and problem-solving skills. We hope that our website project will inspire others to pursue their passion for coding and contribute to the growth of the industry.</p>
